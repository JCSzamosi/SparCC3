SparCC for Python3
==================

This is a port of SparCC by Jonathan Friedman ([paper
here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002687),
original [bitbucket repo
here](https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc/src/default/)) to Python3, including
a few fixes. So far I have fixed it to the point that the example data included
with the scripts runs without raising any errors. I would be thrilled to accept
pull requests that do more maintenance.
