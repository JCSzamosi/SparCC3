    Compute pseudo p-vals from a set correlations obtained from permuted data' 
    Pseudo p-vals are the percentage of times a correlation at least 
    as extreme as the "real" one was observed in simulated datasets.
    
    Files containing the permuted correlations should be named with a 
    consistent template, and these file names cannot contain any "#" characters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cor : DataFrame
        Inferred correlations whose p-values are to be computed.
    perm_template : str
        The template used for naming the correlation files of the 
        permuted data. The iteration number is indicated with a "#".
        For example: 'permuted/cor.sparcc.permuted_#.txt'
    nperm : int
        Number of permutations available.
    test_type : 'two_sided' (default) | 'one_sided'
        two-sided  = considering only the correlation magnitude. 
        one-sided  = accounting for the sign of correlations.
    iprint : int (default = 0)
        The interval at which iteration number is printed out.
        If iprint<=0 no printouts are made.
    
    Returns
    -------
    p_vals: frame
        Computed pseudo p-values.
